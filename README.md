# EmoAnalyzer-Extracting-Emotional-Insights-from-Malayalam-Speech-Signals
EmoAnalyzer leverages advanced machine learning models—Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks—to analyze and classify emotions and gender in Malayalam speech. By using a dataset of 400 audio samples from 10 individuals, the project compares these models' performance to enhance precision in emotion recognition and gender classification. EmoAnalyzer aims to revolutionize applications in real-time mood tracking, responsive interaction systems, and voice-assisted platforms, with potential scalability to other Indian languages.

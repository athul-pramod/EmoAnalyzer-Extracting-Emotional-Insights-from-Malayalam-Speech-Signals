# EmoAnalyzer-Extracting-Emotional-Insights-from-Malayalam-Speech-Signals
EmoAnalyzer leverages advanced machine learning models—Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks—to analyze and classify emotions and gender in Malayalam speech. By using a dataset of 400 audio samples from 10 individuals, the project compares these models' performance to enhance precision in emotion recognition and gender classification. EmoAnalyzer aims to revolutionize applications in real-time mood tracking, responsive interaction systems, and voice-assisted platforms, with potential scalability to other Indian languages.

"The dataset is structured into 5 folders, each representing one of the five emotions: calm, happy, sad, angry, and surprised. Within each folder, audio files are labeled according to a specific format:
The format is:
• Emotion: The first two digits indicate the emotion (01 = calm, 02 = happy, 03 = sad,
04 = angry, 05 = surprised).
• Emotional Intensity: The following two digits indicate the intensity (01 = normal, 02
= strong).
• Statement: The next two digits represent the statement (01 = "ഇന്നലെ ഇവിലെ
മഴ ലെയ്തു", 02 = "വനങ്ങൾ മാറി ലെട്ടിെങ്ങളായി").
• Repetition: The following two digits indicate repetition (01 = 1st repetition, 02 = 2nd
repetition).
• Actor: The final two digits identify the actor (01-10; odd for male, even for female).
